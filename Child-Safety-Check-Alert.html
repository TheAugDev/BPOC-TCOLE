What is the primary purpose of the Child Safety Check Alert List (CSCAL)?", options: ["To issue a statewide AMBER alert.", "For CPS to locate a child and guardian to investigate or provide services.", "To arrest legal guardians who are avoiding CPS.", "To list all children currently in foster care."], answer: "For CPS to locate a child and guardian to investigate or provide services.", explanation: "The CSCAL is an administrative tool for CPS to locate families for investigations or service delivery, not a criminal warrant or a public alert system like AMBER alert." },
                { question: "2. A key difference between a CSCAL entry and a Missing Person report is that in a CSCAL case:", options: ["The child is believed to be in immediate danger.", "The entry is sent to NCIC for nationwide broadcast.", "The child is believed to be with their legal guardian.", "The entry remains in the system indefinitely."], answer: "The child is believed to be with their legal guardian.", explanation: "In a CSCAL situation, CPS has lost contact with the family unit, but the child is presumed to be with their guardian. In a Missing Person case, the guardian does not know the child's whereabouts." },
                { question: "3. An officer locates a child and guardian on the CSCAL. According to CCP Art. 2A.056, what is the officer's first mandatory action?", options: ["Arrest the guardian.", "Take the child into custody.", "Immediately contact DFPS on their dedicated law enforcement line.", "Clear the alert from TCIC."], answer: "Immediately contact DFPS on their dedicated law enforcement line.", explanation: "The first step is always to contact DFPS to get case-specific information and instructions before taking any other action." },
                { question: "4. For how long does a CSCAL entry remain active in TCIC?", options: ["24 hours", "30 days", "12 months", "Indefinitely"], answer: "12 months", explanation: "CSCAL alerts are active for 12 months in the TCIC system unless cleared sooner." },
                { question: "5. Under CCP Art. 2A.056(d), an officer may temporarily detain a person on a CSCAL hit for what specific purpose?", options: ["To issue a citation.", "To search their vehicle for evidence of a crime.", "To ensure the safety and well-being of the child.", "To wait for a CPS caseworker to arrive, no matter how long it takes."], answer: "To ensure the safety and well-being of the child.", explanation: "The statute is clear that the specific, limited purpose of the temporary detention is to assess the child's safety while the officer makes required notifications." },
                { question: "6. An officer takes a child into emergency possession without a court order. Which of the following is NOT an authorized placement location under CCP Art. 2A.058?", options: ["DFPS", "A licensed residential child-care facility", "The home of a relative who just arrived on scene", "A juvenile probation department"], answer: "The home of a relative who just arrived on scene", explanation: "While a relative might eventually be an option after DFPS investigation, they are not an automatic authorized placement for an officer on the street without going through the mandatory database checks." },
                { question: "7. Which of the following scenarios provides legal grounds for an officer to take temporary possession of a child without a court order under Family Code ยง262.104?", options: ["The parent is rude and uncooperative.", "The house is messy and cluttered.", "The officer sees the parent has permitted the child to be on premises used for meth manufacturing.", "The parent admits they are behind on the child's vaccinations."], answer: "The officer sees the parent has permitted the child to be on premises used for meth manufacturing.", explanation: "This is a specific condition listed in the statute. The other options do not rise to the level of 'immediate danger' required for a warrantless removal." },
                { question: "8. Before releasing a child to a non-governmental person, an officer MUST check the DFPS Texas Abuse Hotline for what reason?", options: ["To get the person's criminal history.", "To determine if the person is listed as having abused or neglected a child.", "To confirm the person's home address.", "To get permission from a supervisor."], answer: "To determine if the person is listed as having abused or neglected a child.", explanation: "This check is a mandatory step to ensure the child is not being placed with someone who has a history of child maltreatment." },
                { question: "9. After an officer locates a child on the CSCAL list, speaks with DFPS, and determines the child is safe and will not be taken into custody, what information must be reported to DFPS?", options: ["The officer's opinion of the guardian's parenting skills.", "The child's current address and any other relevant information.", "The make and model of the guardian's vehicle.", "Nothing, the case is closed."], answer: "The child's current address and any other relevant information.", explanation: "Even if the child isn't taken, the primary goal of the CSCAL is met by locating the family. The officer must provide this location information back to DFPS." },
                { question: "10. What is the final step an officer must ensure is completed after a CSCAL encounter where the person is located?", options: ["File a local offense report.", "Notify the child's school.", "Report to TCIC that the person has been located.", "Hand the guardian a CPS business card."], answer: "Report to TCIC that the person has been located.", explanation: "Clearing the alert from TCIC is the final step to ensure other officers don't needlessly stop the person for the same resolved issue." }
