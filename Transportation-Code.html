    <!-- Chosen Palette: THP Official (inspired by patch colors - blue, red, with neutral grays) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-pane SPA. Left pane is a fixed, searchable navigation list of all offenses, grouped by module mirroring the THP manual. Right pane displays the detailed breakdown of the selected offense. This structure is ideal for a training and reference manual, allowing quick access to specific statutes without losing context in the larger body of law. The search function is the primary interaction for quick lookups. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Legal definitions, examples, and officer protocols for the Texas Transportation Code. Goal -> Inform, Organize, Train. Presentation -> Structured HTML text blocks (cards) within the right pane for each statute. Interaction -> Live search/filter in the left nav and click-to-display content updates. Justification -> This is the most effective way to present a large volume of textual reference material for quick access and study. No data visualization is needed. Library/Method -> Vanilla JS for all logic, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
