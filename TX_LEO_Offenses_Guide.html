    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Slates and a muted Blue accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-pane SPA. Left pane is a fixed, searchable navigation list of all offenses, grouped by module. Right pane displays the detailed breakdown of the selected offense. This structure was chosen for speed and ease of reference, allowing an officer to quickly find and digest the elements of a specific crime without losing their place in the overall list. The live search is the key interaction for efficiency. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Legal definitions and examples of criminal offenses. Goal -> Inform, Organize. Presentation -> Structured HTML text blocks (cards) within the right pane. Interaction -> Live search/filter in the left nav and click-to-display content updates. Justification -> This is the most direct and fastest way to present textual reference material. No data visualization is needed as the content is qualitative and legal, not quantitative. Library/Method -> Vanilla JS for all logic, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

Assess for multiple parties and potential weapons. Your mindset should be to de-escalate, separate parties, and ensure medical aid is rendered if necessary.<h4>On-Scene Investigation & Dialogue:</h4><p>Your goal is to determine which of the three types of assault occurred.</p><h5>Element-Specific Questions:</h5><ul><li><strong>(Bodily Injury)</strong> To Victim: 'Where did they touch you? Did it cause you any pain at all?' (Any level of pain satisfies this element).</li><li><strong>(Threat)</strong> To Victim: 'What were their exact words?' 'What were they doing with their hands/body?' 'Did you believe you were about to be physically hurt right then and there?'</li><li><strong>(Offensive Contact)</strong> To Victim: 'Did you give them permission to touch you?' 'How did it make you feel when they [spit on you, poked you]?'</li></ul><h5>Dialogue Examples:</h5><i>To Victim/Witness:</i><br>- 'Please tell me what happened, from the beginning.'<br>- 'Are you injured? Can I call EMS for you?'<br><br><i>To Compliant Suspect:</i><br>- 'I'm trying to get everyone's side of the story. What happened from your perspective?'<br>- 'They're saying you hit them.

I cannot help you if you are yelling.'<br>- 'Did you put your hands on this person? A simple yes or no.'<h4>Potential Force Considerations:</h4> Force should be proportional to the suspect's resistance. Verbal commands are primary. If the suspect is non-compliant but not actively aggressive, empty-hand control (escort holds) may be appropriate. If the suspect becomes actively resistant or assaultive, defensive tactics or less-lethal options (Taser) may be justified.</div>"

Strangulation is a top predictor of future homicide. The mindset is to secure the suspect, ensure the victim is safe, and conduct a thorough investigation for signs of this specific act. Request EMS for the victim, even if they claim to be fine.<h4>On-Scene Investigation & Dialogue:</h4><p>Your goal is to specifically prove the act of impeding breath or circulation.</p><h5>Element-Specific Questions:</h5><ul><li><strong>(Impeding Breath/Circulation)</strong> To Victim: 'Did they put their hands on your neck or throat? Can you show me with one hand where they touched you?' 'Did they cover your mouth and nose?' 'Did you have trouble breathing? Did you feel like you were going to pass out?' 'Did you feel dizzy, see stars, or get a headache?' 'Is your voice raspy now?'</li><li><strong>(Family Relationship)</strong> 'What is your relationship to the suspect?'</li></ul><h5>Dialogue Examples:</h5><i>To Suspect:</i><br>- 'The victim is saying you put your hands on their neck and choked them. Is that what happened?'<br><br><strong>Potential Force Considerations:</strong> The suspect has committed a felony-level act of violence. They may be highly emotional and aggressive. Be prepared for a higher level of resistance than a simple assault.</div>"
