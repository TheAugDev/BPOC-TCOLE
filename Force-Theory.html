                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
                        <li><strong>18 U.S.C. ยง 241 - Conspiracy Against Rights:</strong> Makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in the free exercise of any right secured by the Constitution.</li>
                        <li><strong>18 U.S.C. ยง 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law:</strong> Makes it a crime for a person acting under color of any law to willfully deprive a person of a right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">An officer may face personal liability for failing to stop other officers from using excessive force in their presence. Both non-supervisory and supervisory officers have an affirmative duty to intervene.</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> Officer A sees their partner, Officer B, continuing to strike a subject who is already handcuffed and no longer resisting. Officer A has a legal duty to step in and stop Officer B's actions. Failure to do so could result in Officer A also being held liable.</p>

                        <li>The 4th Amendment limits the level of force to what is reasonable.</li>

                        <li>The need for force will be evaluated against the feasibility of alternatives.</li>
                        <li>The extent of the injury inflicted is a key consideration.</li>
                        <li>An officer can be liable even for a justified use of force if their negligent conduct prior to the use of force created the danger.</li>

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Following a critical incident like an officer-involved shooting, an officer will be subject to an administrative (internal) investigation and potentially a separate criminal investigation.
