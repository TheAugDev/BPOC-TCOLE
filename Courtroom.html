                    <p class="text-sm font-semibold">Legal Definition:</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">At a party's request, the court must order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear other witnesses' testimony. This is often called "invoking the rule."</p>

                    <p class="text-sm mt-2"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> At the start of a trial, the defense attorney says, "Your honor, we invoke the rule." The judge then orders all witnesses in the case, including all police officers who will testify, to leave the courtroom and wait in the hallway. The officers must not talk to each other about what they are going to say on the stand.</p>

                        <p><strong>Honesty:</strong> Display a sincere interest in accuracy. Present a modest demeanor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Brevity:</strong> Be brief and to the point. Do not volunteer information or argue with attorneys.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clarity:</strong> Avoid errors, inconsistencies, and confusion, as they undermine your credibility.</p>
                        <p><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Present an impartial, conscientious picture. Be courteous to both attorneys.</p>
                        <p><strong>Emotional Control:</strong> Ignore insults, badgering, and innuendos. A display of anger diminishes credibility.</p>

                        <li><strong>Avoid Speculation:</strong> Stick to the facts. If asked for an opinion, ensure it is based on facts and make the distinction clear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pause Before Answering:</strong> When the defense attorney asks a question, pause long enough to give the prosecutor time to object.</li>

                        <p><strong>Condescending:</strong> An overly benevolent or patronizing tone to make you seem inept. Your Response: Ask for improperly phrased questions to be repeated, then answer in a confident, decisive manner.</p>
                        <p><strong>Friendly:</strong> An overly courteous approach to lull you into a false sense of security. Your Response: Stay alert and remember their goal is to diminish your testimony.</p>
                        <p><strong>Badgering / Belligerent:</strong> An aggressive approach intended to provoke you into losing emotional control. Your Response: Ignore the behavior, stay calm, speak deliberately, and give the prosecutor time to object.</p>

                    answer: "Offensive",
                    explanation: "The 'Offensive' tactic uses rapid-fire questioning to confuse the witness and procure inconsistent answers. The proper response is to remain calm and take your time."

                    options: ["Answer the question anyway", "Ask the judge to explain the ruling", "Remain silent and do not answer", "Ask the prosecutor to rephrase the question"],
                    answer: "Remain silent and do not answer",
                    explanation: "A 'sustained' objection means the judge agrees with the objection, and the witness may not answer the question."

                    explanation: "Invoking 'The Rule' (TRE 614, CCP 36.03) is the process of excluding witnesses from the courtroom."

                    answer: "Aggravated Perjury",
                    explanation: "Because the false statement was made during an official proceeding (a trial) and was material, the offense is elevated from Perjury to Aggravated Perjury, a 3rd Degree Felony."

                    answer: "'That is all I can recall.'",
                    explanation: "If you have exhausted your memory on a point, stating 'That is all I can recall' is an appropriate and honest response. 'I don't know' implies the facts were never observed."

                    answer: "Friendly",

                    answer: "Memorize a script provided by the prosecutor",
                    explanation: "An officer should be familiar with the facts but must testify from their own memory and knowledge, not a script. This ensures authenticity and credibility."
