                        <div><strong>Adjective:</strong> A word that describes or modifies a noun. (e.g., "a <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">brave</span> officer," "a <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">new</span> car").</div>
                        <div><strong>Adverb:</strong> A word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. It answers questions like When?, Where?, How?, and To what degree? (e.g., "moved <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">expeditiously</span>").</div>
                        <div><strong>Noun:</strong> The name of a person, place, thing, quality, concept, or action. (e.g., "The <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">officer</span> received an <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">assignment</span>.").</div>
                        <div><strong>Preposition:</strong> A word that combines with a noun or pronoun to form a phrase. (e.g., "They expected resistance <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">on</span> their part.").</div>
                        <div><strong>Verb:</strong> Expresses an act, occurrence, or mode of being. (e.g., "The suspect <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">ran</span> from the officer.").</div>
                        <div><strong>Pronoun:</strong> A word used as a substitute for a noun. (e.g., "<span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">Who</span> is <span class="font-bold text-emerald-700">she</span>?").</div>

                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Misplaced Modifiers:</h4>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">A modifier is a word or phrase that qualifies another word. It should be placed as close as possible to the word it modifies. Misplacing it can create confusing or unintentionally humorous sentences.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Double Negatives:</h4>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">Avoid using two negative words in the same clause (e.g., not, no, never, none, nobody, nothing, barely, hardly, scarcely).</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">Active voice is stronger, clearer, and more direct. The subject performs the action. In passive voice, the subject receives the action. Use active voice unless the actor is unknown.</p>
                    <p class="text-sm mt-2 p-3 bg-emerald-50 rounded-md"><strong>Passive:</strong> The bystander was hit by a stray bullet.<br><strong>Active:</strong> A stray bullet hit a bystander.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Slang, Jargon, and Nonstandard Abbreviations:</h4>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">Write professionally. Avoid informal language unless you are directly quoting someone. If you must use an abbreviation, write it out completely the first time followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.</p>

                { question: "1. In the sentence 'The officer moved quickly,' what part of speech is 'quickly'?", options: ["Adjective", "Noun", "Verb", "Adverb"], answer: "Adverb", explanation: "'Quickly' is an adverb because it modifies the verb 'moved,' answering the question 'How?'" },
                { question: "2. Which of the following is a run-on sentence?", options: ["The suspect ran. He was caught later.", "The suspect ran, he was caught later.", "The suspect who ran was caught later.", "After the suspect ran, he was caught later."], answer: "The suspect ran, he was caught later.", explanation: "This is a comma splice, a type of run-on sentence. Two complete sentences are joined only by a comma. They need to be separated by a period or joined with a semicolon or conjunction." },
                { question: "3. 'The attorney gave her client sound ________.' Which word correctly completes the sentence?", options: ["council", "counsel", "consul", "cancel"], answer: "counsel", explanation: "'Counsel' means advice. 'Council' is a group that consults or advises." },
                { question: "4. An officer's report states: 'The bystander was hit by a stray bullet.' This is an example of:", options: ["Active Voice", "Passive Voice", "A Sentence Fragment", "A Run-on Sentence"], answer: "Passive Voice", explanation: "The subject ('The bystander') is receiving the action. The active voice version would be 'A stray bullet hit the bystander,' which is clearer and more direct." },
                { question: "5. What is the best way to write 'at this point in time' in a police report?", options: ["Currently", "At the present time", "Now", "Then"], answer: "Now", explanation: "Police reports should be concise. 'Now' communicates the same meaning as 'at this point in time' with fewer words, eliminating 'deadwood.'" },
                { question: "6. Which of the following should NOT be included in an officer's field notes?", options: ["The suspect's date of birth", "A direct quote from a witness", "The officer's personal opinion about the suspect's guilt", "The time the offense was reported"], answer: "The officer's personal opinion about the suspect's guilt", explanation: "Field notes, like reports, should be objective and factual. Personal opinions and non-police information should be excluded." },
                { question: "7. The acronym 'CYMBAL' is used to help officers remember how to describe what?", options: ["People", "Property", "Locations", "Vehicles"], answer: "Vehicles", explanation: "CYMBAL stands for Color, Year, Make/Model, Body Style, And... (distinguishing features), and License Plate." },
                { question: "8. Which is NOT one of the eight essential criteria of a good police report?", options: ["Objective", "Concise", "Subjective", "Complete"], answer: "Subjective", explanation: "A good police report must be objective, not subjective. The eight criteria are: Accurate, Concise, Complete, Clear, Legible, Objective, Grammatically Correct, and Correct Spelling." },

Arranging information by category, such as by witness, suspect, and evidence, is known as what type of ordering?", options: ["Categorical", "Alphabetical", "Chronological", "Numerical"], answer: "Categorical", explanation: "Categorical ordering groups information by type, which can be useful in complex cases, whereas chronological ordering arranges it by time." },
                { question: "10. 'Please ______ the gun on the table.' Which word correctly completes the sentence?", options: ["lie", "lay", "laid", "lain"], answer: "lay", explanation: "'Lay' means to place an object. 'Lie' means to recline. You are asking someone to place the gun." },
                { question: "11. 'Wrapped in a blanket, the paramedic attended to the victim.' What is the error in this sentence?", options: ["Run-on sentence", "Double negative", "Misplaced modifier", "Sentence fragment"], answer: "Misplaced modifier", explanation: "The modifier 'Wrapped in a blanket' incorrectly describes the paramedic. The sentence should be rewritten: 'The paramedic attended to the victim, who was wrapped in a blanket.'" },
                { question: "12. Under CCP Chapter 58, a victim of a sex offense has the right to:", options: ["Refuse to testify in court.", "Have their own investigator assigned.", "Use a pseudonym in all public records.", "Receive financial compensation immediately."], answer: "Use a pseudonym in all public records.", explanation: "This statute allows victims of certain offenses to choose a pseudonym to protect their identity in public files and records." },

                { question: "14. Select the correct sentence:", options: ["Its a shame that the dog lost it's collar.", "It's a shame that the dog lost its collar.", "Its a shame that the dog lost its collar.", "It's a shame that the dog lost it's collar."], answer: "It's a shame that the dog lost its collar.", explanation: "'It's' is a contraction for 'it is.' 'Its' is the possessive form. The dog possessed the collar." },
                { question: "15. The phrase 'true facts' is an example of what kind of writing error?", options: ["Misplaced Modifier", "Redundancy / Needless Repetition", "Sentence Fragment", "Double Negative"], answer: "Redundancy / Needless Repetition", explanation: "This is a form of 'deadwood.' All facts are true by definition, so the word 'true' is redundant and should be removed." },
                { question: "16. Which punctuation mark is used to link two closely related complete sentences without a conjunction?", options: ["Comma", "Colon", "Semicolon", "Apostrophe"], answer: "Semicolon", explanation: "A semicolon (;) can join two independent clauses. For example: 'Some people write well; others do not.'" },
                { question: "17. An officer wants to ________ a confession from the suspect. The suspect was arrested for selling ________ drugs.", options: ["illicit, elicit", "elicit, illicit", "elicit, elicit", "illicit, illicit"], answer: "elicit, illicit", explanation: "'Elicit' means to draw out or bring forth.

A report that is written to add information to an original report is called a:", options: ["Crash Report", "Supplemental Report", "Incident Report", "Arrest Report"], answer: "Supplemental Report", explanation: "Supplemental reports are used to document follow-up actions or add information to an initial case report." },
                { question: "19. Which sentence contains a double negative?", options: ["The witness could not hardly see the suspect.", "The witness could see the suspect.", "The witness could hardly see the suspect.", "The witness saw nothing."], answer: "The witness could not hardly see the suspect.", explanation: "'Could not' and 'hardly' are both negative in meaning. The correct sentence would be 'The witness could hardly see the suspect.'" },
                { question: "20. Which sentence correctly uses quotation marks with other punctuation?", options: ["The witness shouted, 'He has a gun'!", "The witness stated, 'I saw the car'; then he left.", "The witness asked, 'Did you see that?'", "The witness said, 'It was blue.'."], answer: "The witness asked, 'Did you see that?'", explanation: "The question mark applies to the quoted material, so it goes inside the quotation marks. Semicolons go outside. Periods always go inside. Exclamation points only go inside if they are part of the original quote." }
