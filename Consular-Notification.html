                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Legal Definition:</strong> An international treaty that outlines the framework for consular relations between independent states. Its purpose is to ensure that a foreign national arrested or detained in another country is not cut off from assistance from their own government.</p>

                        <li>A foreign detainee must be informed of their right to have their consulate notified.</li>
                        <li>The detainee's decision whether to notify must be documented.</li>
                        <li>Applies to ALL foreign detainees, regardless of their immigration status (legal or illegal).</li>
                        <li>If the detainee requests notification, it must be done "without delay."</li>
                        <li>Consular officers have the right to visit, correspond with, and arrange legal representation for their nationals in detention.</li>

The officer knows that because the driver is a foreign national, they have certain rights under the VCCR and begins the notification procedure.</p>
