                     <p class="text-sm mt-4 p-3 bg-red-50 rounded-md"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> An officer stops a car for swerving. The driver has slurred speech, red glassy eyes, and a strong odor of alcohol. The driver is intoxicated because they do not have the normal use of their mental and physical faculties, regardless of their BAC. If a breath test later shows a 0.10 BAC, they are also intoxicated *per se*.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides a systematic approach to identifying intoxicated drivers, broken into three phases. Each phase builds on the last to develop probable cause for arrest.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Phase One: Vehicle in Motion</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Observe the vehicle in operation to determine if reasonable suspicion exists to initiate a traffic stop.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key Cues:</strong> Weaving, drifting, swerving, turning with a wide radius, driving without headlights at night, speeding or driving unusually slow, and braking erratically.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p class="text-sm mt-4 p-3 bg-red-50 rounded-md"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> At 2 AM, an officer observes a vehicle drifting from the center line to the shoulder line multiple times. This "weaving" provides the officer with reasonable suspicion that the driver may be intoxicated, justifying a traffic stop.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Phase Two: Personal Contact</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> After the stop, observe and speak with the driver to determine if there is sufficient cause to ask them to exit the vehicle for further testing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key Cues:</strong> Odor of alcoholic beverage, slurred speech, red/glassy/watery eyes, fumbling with license/insurance, soiled clothing, admission of drinking.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p class="text-sm mt-4 p-3 bg-red-50 rounded-md"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> Upon contacting the driver from the previous example, the officer smells a strong odor of alcohol from within the car and notices the driver's eyes are red and glassy. The officer asks the driver to step out for sobriety tests.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 text-sm">Phase Three: Pre-Arrest Screening (SFSTs)</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) to determine if there is probable cause to arrest for DWI.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Three Tests:</strong> Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN), Walk and Turn, and One-Leg Stand.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p class="text-sm mt-4 p-3 bg-red-50 rounded-md"><strong>Practical Example:</strong> The officer administers the SFSTs. The driver shows 6/6 clues on HGN, steps off the line multiple times on the Walk and Turn, and puts their foot down three times on the One-Leg Stand. Based on the totality of circumstances (driving, physical cues, and SFST performance), the officer develops probable cause and arrests the driver for DWI.</p>

The officer's only recourse to compel a sample is to seek a search warrant from a neutral magistrate." },
