                     <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">The underlying element behind mental illness-related behavior is usually not criminal or malicious. The CIT program was conceived in Memphis, TN, after a 1987 incident where police shot and killed a 26-year-old man with a history of mental illness who was threatening suicide. This event catalyzed the creation of CIT.</p>
                     <h4 class="font-semibold mt-3">The Problem for Law Enforcement:</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700">
                         <li>Individuals with mental illness generate no less than 1 in 10 calls for police service.</li>
                         <li>The risk of being killed when stopped by law enforcement is 16 times higher for individuals with untreated serious mental illness.</li>
                         <li>In 2015, 25% of all fatal officer-involved shootings involved a subject displaying signs of mental illness.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">Texas Senate Bill 1849</h2>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">This bill established significant mandates for Texas law enforcement regarding mental health response.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>De-escalation Training:</strong> Law enforcement officers are required to learn de-escalation techniques to reduce the use of force.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diversion Efforts:</strong> Agencies must make a good faith effort to divert persons suffering from a mental health crisis or substance abuse to proper treatment facilities rather than incarcerating them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Bond:</strong> The bill establishes an easier process for individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability to receive a personal bond.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statutory Changes:</strong> Key changes were made to the <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1701.htm" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Occupations Code, Chapter 1701</a>, specifically sections 1701.253 and 1701.273, cementing these training requirements.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">Primary Goal of CIT</h2>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">"The primary goal of CITs involves calming persons with mental illness who are in crisis and referring them to mental health care services, rather than incarcerating them." This includes lessening injuries to officers and individuals, decriminalizing mental illness, reducing stigma, and using a team approach.</p>
                     <h4 class="font-semibold mt-3">Key Objectives:</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700">
                         <li>Educate officers on recognizing signs of mental illness.</li>
                         <li>Provide practical de-escalation skills to mitigate violence.</li>
                         <li>Increase officer and public safety.</li>
                         <li>Provide information on safely transporting individuals to appropriate facilities.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">CIT's Impact on Community Relations</h2>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">CIT has been shown to positively impact officer perceptions, decrease the need for higher levels of police intervention, and reduce officer injuries. It redirects individuals from the justice system to the healthcare system, building public trust.</p>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>National Presence:</strong> 46 of the 50 states have CIT programs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced Use of Force:</strong> A study of Houston PD found CIT officers were 82% less likely to use their guns on CIT-related calls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> The Bexar County Sheriff's Office CIT program saved the county nearly $100 million over eight years and drastically reduced use-of-force incidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Officer Confidence:</strong> Research shows CIT improves officer comfort, knowledge, and attitudes towards individuals with mental illness.</li>
